Project DE(development enviroment) AKA  interactive browser-based coding environment

it's like a Jupyter Notebook, but for Javascript, with many additional features added in

 This task is done by running Webpack and Babel at your terminal. Idea is to execute users code safely in the browser just like how services like CodeSandBox and CodePen do. It is deployed using multi-package architecture to NPM, where your friends and employers can easily download and run the project.
